We are collaborating on a GitHub project to enhance our understanding and
application of version control while improving our programming skills.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on solving a selected set of problems while learning how
to effectively use GitHub for version control. The selection process for these
problems mimicked the **Secret Santa** game:

1. We discussed each member's strengths and weaknesses, level of experience, and
knowledge.
2. Based on this discussion, a list of problems was created, ensuring that each
participant received two problems chosen by another member.

### Learning Goals

- Gain hands-on experience with GitHub workflows.
- Collaborate effectively within a team.
- Improve programming skills through problem-solving and peer reviews.
- Provide constructive feedback on each other's code.

More on Learning Goals in `collaberations/learning_goals.md`

## Workflow

Here is a step-by-step guide to our workflow:

1. **Branch Creation**: Create a new branch named after your problem file.
2. **File Addition**: Add your problem file(s) to the branch.
3. **Issue Creation**: Create an issue for the problem and a corresponding card
on the project board.
4. **Pull Request**: Once the problem is solved, add the solutions with
corresponding test file as a commit, and create a pull request (PR) to merge
your changes into the main branch.
5. **Card Update**: Update the card on the project board and mark it as "Ready
for Review."
6. **Peer Review**: Another member will review your code and provide feedback.
7. **Merge**: After addressing any feedback, your PR can be merged into the main
branch.

## Collaboration Tools

- **GitHub Project Board**: Tracks the progress of issues and pull requests.
- **Slack**: Main Communication tool
- **Google Meet**: Meetings three times a week, or according to requirements.
- **Collaboration Directory**: Contains additional details about:
  - Collaboration process.
  - Learning objectives.
  - Meeting notes.

## Meetings and Sessions

We conducted several meetings and one dedicated session on GitHub usage. During
these, we discussed:

- General GitHub commands.
- Best practices for our workflow.
- Troubleshooting common issues.

Meetings times and agenda are discussed a few days before the date to schedule
best time that suits the majority of the team. Voting is done through **Polly**,
a third party service of Slack.
