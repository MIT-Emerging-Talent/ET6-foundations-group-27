# Communication

As a team we agreed that we will make a poll in Slack
to check the validity of all the team, and will take the highest vote
as the meeting time. And before ending the meeting will discuss
about what do we want to do, what will be our next step
and what is the timeline for these tasks.
We use Google Meet as the meeting channel,
while Slack is the channel for quick questions,
meetings plans and friendly communication channel.
We use GitHub as the basic channel for coding,
rase a challenge or any professional communication.

## Asking for Help

There's a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes, and
stubbornly getting no where. Here is a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub
